# Generic codes written in C using generic pointer void *, which is used to point any type of variables.

### Codes written using void * or generic codes which is intended to work regardless of the data type, must be handled carefully, as it can lead to potential errors even unchecked by compiler.

### Inspite of potential loopholes, it is better than templates in the sense that only a single piece of code can be used for many data types. There will be only one copy of the compiled code unlike in case of Template one copy for each data type.
